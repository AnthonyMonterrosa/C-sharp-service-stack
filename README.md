# C-sharp-service-stack
This repository is my practice sandbox for creating a C# application from the bottom to the top. This includes:
* Saving/reading from a database
* Managing tasks, code, and CI/CD
* Manage artifacts and environments for dev and prod

And whatever else is involved in making a website with a C# backend.
